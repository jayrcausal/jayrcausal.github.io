I am a researcher at NYU (off 2024 to Boston).  I work on causal inference methodology and its applications such as policy learning for healthcare, causality discovery for genes and cells intervention. I also make marginal contribution to applied causal inference by improving credibility in regression discontinuity design. I was fortunately supervised by <a href="https://bryantjmoy.com/">Prof.Bryant Moy</a> at NYU Center for Data Science and <a href="https://michelesantacatterina.github.io/">Prof.Michele</a> at Grossman School of Medicine at NYU Langone.

__Research Interests__: My research interest broadly spans manifolds of causal inference and causality discovery and my recent focus has been 

- Causal Inference:  causal graphical models and applied causal inference
- Precision Medicine: causal discovery and representation learning in cell perturbation,genetic causal mechanism for treatment regimen planning and root-cause of disease.

For NYU students interested causal inference research, I write the [notes](https://jr5674.wixsite.com/mysite/causal-inference-course) for causal inference courses

_I am going to plan an interview series on the topics,**Talking to Causality**, a unique theme where I will invite and talk to big-names in causal inference research. Those interviews will be recorded as a public resource for people to watch according to their personal interest. Please check back later._
