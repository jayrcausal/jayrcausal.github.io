I am a graduate student at NYU (2024 off to Boston). At NYU, I was fortunately supervised by <a href="https://bryantjmoy.com/">Prof.Bryant Moy</a> at NYU Center for Data Science and <a href="https://michelesantacatterina.github.io/">Prof.Michele</a> at Grossman School of Medicine at NYU Langone. I received my master's degree jointly in [Engineering and Courant Institute of Mathematics](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/sites/tandon/). I completed my undergraduate study as a student in Management Science and Engineering(with a concentration of engineering mechanics) where I also had the great fortune to be supervised by Prof Li Zhao(赵丽).

__Research Interests__: My research interest broadly spans manifolds of causal inference and my recent focus has been primarily on life sciences:

- Causal representation learning: causal mechanism for gene regulation,cell perturbation and root-cause exploration of diseases.
- Off-policy learning: off-policy learning for dynamic treatment regimen planning

For NYU students interested causal inference research, I write the [notes](https://jr5674.wixsite.com/mysite/causal-inference-course) for causal inference courses

_I am going to plan an interview series on the topics,[**'BornCausal'**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1xuZ2oXQCDQWtZx1v7OIGw)(abbreviated for Best of Research in Causal), a unique theme where I will invite and talk to big-names in causal inference research. Those interviews will be recorded as a public resource for people to watch according to their personal interest. Please check back later._
